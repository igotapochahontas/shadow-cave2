A three dimensional oscilloscope designed for modeling. 
Virtual reality organic life modeling from sound and electromagnetism.  Exports to .Obj if used inside of droidscript for android. Makes virtual reality into reality if used with a 3d printer. Can be used to synthesize organic life if used with a modified miller urey device (requires a musical tesla coil instead of a dc hv spark gap) Due to chrome and safari disabling autoplay, this demo works best with firefox web browser for android or installed locally and launched from droidscript.
